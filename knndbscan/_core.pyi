    """Perform kNN-DBSCAN clustering on a dataset using a precomputed k-nearest neighbors graph.

    This function implements a variant of DBSCAN that uses a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) graph
    for efficient density-based clustering. It supports parallel execution using OpenMP and
    can be used in distributed environments with MPI.

    Args:
        N (int): Total number of data points in the dataset.
        eps (float): Maximum distance (epsilon) for considering two points as neighbors.
                     Points within this distance are considered density-reachable.
        minPts (int): Minimum number of points required to form a dense region (core point).
        k (int): Number of nearest neighbors stored for each point (excluding self).
                 Should be at least minPts - 1.
        JA (numpy.ndarray of int): Array of neighbor indices from the kNN graph.
                                   Shape should be (N * k,), stored in row-major order.
        A (numpy.ndarray of float): Array of distances corresponding to the neighbors in JA.
                                    Shape should be (N * k,), stored in row-major order.
        threads (int, optional): Number of OpenMP threads to use for parallel computation.
                                 Defaults to 1 (single-threaded).

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray of int: Cluster labels for each point. Shape is (N,).
                              - Core points in clusters are assigned positive cluster IDs.
                              - Border points are assigned the same ID as their core point.
                              - Noise points are assigned -1.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If MPI initialization fails or if input arrays have invalid shapes/sizes.

    Note:
        The kNN graph should be precomputed and provided as JA and A arrays.
        The function assumes the graph is undirected and that distances are symmetric.
        MPI is initialized automatically if not already done, but not finalized to allow
        multiple calls within the same Python process.
